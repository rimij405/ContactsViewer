# ContactsViewer
Web application that allows users to upload *.csv files and work with existing contacts in the database, in order to perform search functions.

## Adding Contacts
You can add contacts to the server by accessing the "Upload" page.
From here, you are able to choose an existing Recruiter or create a new Recruiter to add information to.

After choosing a Recruiter, you're able to add contacts in one of two ways:
- Uploading a *.csv file, exported from LinkedIn.
- Inputting a new contact directly to the system.

## Searching Contacts
You can search the database for contacts by accessing the "Search" page.
From here, you are able to search via different search fields.
Search results depend on the different flags used such as:
- Match case.
- Match whole word.
- Search [fields] only.

**This final flag depends on whether or not you are searching by one of the established fields such as first name, last name, etc.**

## Sorting Contacts
Search results are able to be sorted according to one of the various fields.
